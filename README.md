# PfisterPhysics
This is a Physics simulation that I (Eric Pfister) am actively working on as of January 7th, 2015.
As of now I am the only person working on this project. I will not add anyone else to the team that cannot contact me in real life.
This simulation is quite badly commented, unorganized, and all manner of other bad sounding adjectives.
I do not recommend anyone to try and learn from it until it is fully optimized, organized, and functionalized.
